# 👋 Hi, I’m @Freshta-Jafari

  Web development, specifically front-end and back-end technologies. I enjoy building responsive and interactive websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.

  PHP (Object-Oriented Programming), and exploring frameworks like Laravel. I'm also enhancing my skills in database management (MySQL), Figma for UI/UX design, and improving my knowledge in RESTful APIs.

  I'm working on personal projects such as creating a class-based PHP application for managing contracts and employees. I also have experience in designing mockups and prototypes for web applications.

- 🎯 **Looking to collaborate on:**  
  Building complete websites, both front-end and back-end. I'm open to collaborating on open-source projects, learning more about JavaScript frameworks (React, Vue.js), or contributing to PHP-based projects.
